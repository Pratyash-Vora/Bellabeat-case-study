   Thursday, Friday, and Sunday show lower activity.

3. **Sleep Coaching Features**  
   Integrate reminders, sleep scores, and gentle nudges.

4. **Progressive Goal Setting**  
   Step ladders (8k → 9k → 10k) increase goal adoption.

5. **Motivational Calorie Insights**  
   Use calories-burned trends to reward activity streaks.
